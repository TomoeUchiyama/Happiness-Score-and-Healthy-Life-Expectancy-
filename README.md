# Project: Happiness Score and Healthy Life Expectancy

## Overview
This project investigates the relationship between happiness scores and healthy life expectancy using a random sample of 30 countries from the World Happiness Report dataset. It applies confidence interval analysis, hypothesis testing, and regression techniques, including multivariate regression.

## Data Source
- **World Happiness Report**  
  URL: [https://worldhappiness.report/data/](https://worldhappiness.report/data/)

- Variables Used:  
  - Happiness Score  
  - Healthy Life Expectancy  
  - Social Support  
  - GDP per Capita (Logged)  
  - Other indicators (for multivariate analysis)

## Objectives
- Develop 95% and 99% confidence intervals
- Conduct hypothesis tests (P-value method)
- Perform regression and correlation analysis
- Predict happiness scores using healthy life expectancy and social support

## Key Findings
- 95% CI for life expectancy: **[63.99, 67.31] years**
- Strong positive correlation (r ≈ 0.71) between happiness and healthy life expectancy
- Regression coefficient (b₁) ≈ 0.19 indicates that each additional year of healthy life adds to happiness
- Social support has a significant impact in multivariate regression; life expectancy alone becomes statistically insignificant

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel  
- Statistical formulas (Z-distribution, regression)  
- Random sampling via Excel's RANDBETWEEN()
